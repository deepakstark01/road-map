# **Machine Learning / Deep Learning Roadmap**

Below is a condensed roadmap if you already have strong math skills and Python experience. The timeline is approximate and assumes 10–15 hours/week of focused study and practice.

## **Phase 1: Quick Data & Library Mastery (1–2 weeks)**

### **Data Handling & Exploratory Analysis**
- **NumPy**: Arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations.  
- **Pandas**: Data frames, `groupby`, merging, joining.  
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn**: Quick visualizations.

### **Light Math/Stats “Spot-Check”**
- **Key distributions**: Normal, uniform, Bernoulli, etc.  
- **Basics of hypothesis testing**: Confidence intervals, p-values (useful for ML experimentation).  
- **Gradients (for gradient descent)**: Partial derivatives and chain rule.

## **Phase 2: Classical Machine Learning (3–5 weeks)**

### **Core ML Algorithms**
- **Regression**: Linear, polynomial, Lasso, Ridge.  
- **Classification**: Logistic regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost.  
- **Unsupervised**: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA (dimensionality reduction).

### **Implementation in scikit-learn**
- **Model pipeline**: Train/test splits, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (`GridSearchCV` / `RandomizedSearchCV`).  
- **Evaluation**: Precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC AUC, MSE, R², etc.

### **Project Work**
1. Pick 1 or 2 real datasets (e.g., [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)) for **end-to-end** pipelines:
   - Data cleaning & feature engineering.  
   - Model training + hyperparameter optimization.  
   - Evaluation & interpretation of results.
2. **Deployment** (optional at this stage):  
   - Flask or FastAPI for a simple **ML model API**.

## **Phase 3: Deep Learning Foundations (4–6 weeks)**

### **Neural Network Basics**
- Perceptrons, activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, etc.).  
- Forward pass, backpropagation (chain rule).  
- Gradient descent optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp).

### **TensorFlow/Keras OR PyTorch**
- **Keras (TensorFlow)**: Easier for quick prototyping.  
- **PyTorch**: Very popular in research and for custom models.
- Cover building feedforward networks, training loops, and debugging common issues (overfitting, vanishing gradients).

### **CNNs & Basic Computer Vision**
- Convolution, pooling, filters, feature maps.  
- Practice with datasets like **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, or any relevant image dataset.



## **Phase 4: Advanced Topics & MLOps (Ongoing)**

### **Refine Projects**
- **Deployment** on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure).  
- **Automate training pipelines** (CI/CD).  
- Use **experiment tracking** tools (Weights & Biases, MLflow).

### **Learn MLOps Fundamentals**
- **Containerization**: Docker.  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (for large-scale apps).  
- **Monitoring**: Model performance & continuous learning processes.

### **Specialize**
1. **Computer Vision**:  
   - Object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN),  
   - Segmentation (Mask R-CNN, U-Net).  
2. **NLP**:  
   - Advanced transformers,  
   - Sequence-to-sequence models,  
   - Question answering, text generation.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: If it aligns with your goals.

### **Stay Updated**
- Read new research on [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).  
- Follow top ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).

## **How Long Will It Take With Strong Math Skills?**

1. **Phase 1 (1–2 weeks)**: Quick ramp-up on data manipulation/visualization.  
2. **Phase 2 (3–5 weeks)**: Classical ML fundamentals.  
3. **Phase 3 (4–6 weeks)**: Deep Learning basics; build small projects to solidify.  
4. **Phase 4 (ongoing)**: Continuous learning in advanced/specialty areas.

> **Overall**: Around **2–3 months** of focused study/practice can get you to a comfortable ML/DL level, given your strong math and Python skills. After that, how deep you go depends on your chosen specialization.
